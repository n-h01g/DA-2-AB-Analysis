### Project Details

#### Introduction
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. 

For this project, a company developed a new e-commerce web page in order to increase the number of users who "convert", meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run and understand if the company should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

#### Result
There was not sufficient evidence to suggest that the new page converts better than the old one.
